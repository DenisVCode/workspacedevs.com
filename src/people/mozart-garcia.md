In 2016 I became Google Certified Innovator (MEX16 Cohort). In 2017 I got the Google Trainer Cert. Late in 2017 I got a MBA implmenting the G Suite ecosystem to automate tasks in my work. In 2018 I started to use Google Apps Script. Since then, I have developed some little applications to automate some process and workflows.
