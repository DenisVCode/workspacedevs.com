Hello! I’m an educator, writer, developer and founder of The Collins School of Data and SheetsCon, the online Google Sheets conference. I’ve taught professional spreadsheet techniques to over 30,000 students across 10 online courses. I teach about working with data, with a particular focus on Google Sheets and Apps Script.
